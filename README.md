# What are shaders?
To put it simply, shaders are small programs that run on the GPU, and can affect what the final image looks like.
Shadertoy runs a shader for each pixel on the screen (This is known as the fragment shader).

Unreal instead uses Materials, which uses a visual representation.
Under the hood this gets converted to a shader.
Note that unreal (and all other game engines) also have a vertex shader.

The vertex shader moves the vertices that make up a mesh, which allows you to change what the final mesh looks like
This is handy for adding detail, but it's also essential for actual rendering, but we'll skip this in the tutorial, as unreal handles the vertex shader already

### Shader languages
There are several shader languages (programming languages for shaders)
Shadertoy uses GLSL, while unreal allows programming custom shaders in HLSL
